#### Observable 1: Charter schools tend to have higher passing rates than District schools.

When we compare math and reading test scores based on school type, we see a big disparity in Percent Overall Passing Rates. The percentage difference between Charter (95%) and District (74%) overall passing rates is 21%. This is a big difference. Breaking it down, we see that 6% of students are not passing math and 3% are not passing reading tests in Charter schools. While, 33% of students are not passing math and 19% are not passing reading tests in District-type schools. Analyzing all 15 schools, we see the Top 5 Performing schools are all Charter and the Bottom 5 Performing schools are all District; further strengthening our observable where Charter schools tend to outperform District schools.

#### Observable 2 and 3: Smaller number of students and lower budgets per student have a positive impact on test scores.

Binning test scores by school size and spending range leads us to find smaller schools (less than 2,000 students) and lower budgets per student (less than $615) both have 95% overall passing rates. Delving deeper, four of the Top 5 Performing schools have smaller than 2,000 students and all 5 of the Bottom 5 Performing Schools have larger than 2,000 students. Furthermore, 4 of the Top 5 Performing Schools have budgets less than $630 per student and all 5 of the Bottom Performing schools have budgets more than $630 per student. Although there is not a single budget per student number that can separate all the overperforming from underperforming schools--because the value may shift--we can safely state there exists a positive correlation between school size and preferable test scores. A similar conclusion is applicable between lower budgets per student and test scores.
